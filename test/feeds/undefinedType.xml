could not last. A guy like Petr Cech sitting on the bench, it is not easy. I think that everyone knows the value of Petr Cech as a goalkeeper and I think now after the season just gone people know the value of him as a man. He never said anything despite his situation, he always defended the club.&#

                <![CDATA[
8221;</span></em></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">On Cech&#8217;s future:</span></strong></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I think that Petr at 33 years of age still has at least 3 or 4 excellent seasons in him. Whichever top club, all the clubs in the Champions League, he has the level, the experience to play for any of these clubs. A guy like Petr Cech adds value, whether it is Manchester United, Real Madrid all the clubs. Each time he played this season, he played 15 times, he was absolutely remarkable. His professionalism, he loves football, he&#8217;s an enthusiast, he is a perfectionist and the club where he goes will have a great opportunity ahead of them.&#8221;</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I know that it is talked about a lot (Cech to PSG), I am far from France but I keep up to date via internet. It is obvious that Petr Cech has added value, not that Sirigu is a poor goalkeeper, but I think that Cech is even better than him. Petr knows Ligue 1 well, the problem is when you come from the English league, with all the pressure that comes with it, the quality, the aggressiveness and the rigour that comes with this league, without criticising the French league, but it is true that the competition in France is a little lighter compared to the English league.&#8221;</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I also think that his family is very happy in England. A player is happy when his family is happy. And Petr adds a lot of value to the state of his family. I think he would prefer to stay in England. If there are discussions, I wouldn&#8217;t know. I think that his first aim is to stay in England.&#8221;</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;He wants to be in England more. However at the age of 33, you also have to look at the value of the contracts that are offered. The advantage of a club like Arsenal is that it is a club at a very high level. With a style of play that Petr likes, it is also in London, don&#8217;t forget that. And finally it is a club with big ambitions for the forthcoming seasons.&#8221;</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Does Tottenham have the same ambitions that a club like Arsenal has? Petr has three main aims. To enjoy himself, to win titles and to beat the all time Premier League clean sheet record, he is three away from that. To win titles, I think Arsenal are better placed than Tottenham. The Champions League, I think it is more Arsenal than Tottenham no?&#8221;</span></em></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">On Steve Mandanda:</span></strong></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;It is not easy to leave a club (as a goalkeeper). After that all depends on, the aims that you have and on the league where you want to be. I have always said that the English league is the hardest for goalkeepers, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that every goalkeeper in the English league is good. Hugo Lloris has shown that he has the qualities to play in England, even if I think I still have some reservations over his ability to deal with aerial situations. I have heard that Steve wants to come to play in England. There are places that could become available. I don&#8217;t know what exactly is going on at Manchester United, but I think they&#8217;re drawing closer to Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, the Dutchman, but there was also this desire to take Lloris, because he is quite similar to De Gea. I don&#8217;t think anything is done, I know Crystal Palace are also looking for a goalkeeper so there are doors that could open for goalkeepers.&#8221;</span></em></p>

wo years ago, Payet has been earning €350k gross a month, but this has been dropped to €250k gross a month as a result of Marseille&#8217;s finish in Ligue 1 for the 2014/15 season. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to sources close to the club, &#8220;Marseille must renegotiate his contract or risk losing him&#8221;.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Payet had the following to say to the newspaper on manager Marcelo Bielsa:</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;He does not want to let me go. He asks me each game to reflect on myself after each game and make better immediately what went wrong. I have never known that in my career. When we look at the playing style of Marseille last season, it was an absolute joy to be playing in this system and to play all the games to win them.&#8221;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">If this wage issue is not resolved, Payet will have no choice but to look at the offers coming to him from the Premier League. In this regard, West Ham are in the driving seat, ready to offer the player €400k gross a month on a four year deal. More undoubtedly to follow.</span></p>

ks.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Marseille President Vincent Labrune had been banking on the sale of Imbula, but Valencia are believed to have pulled out of a deal because of the signing of Rodrigo Caio, a move made by Jorge Mendes and Valencia owner Peter Lim which has infuriated the Valencia board, who wanted Imbula instead.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Inter Milan are however well positioned for the player and talks are ongoing, but it is believed that Marseille are asking for a little more than the €19m initially offered, wanting closer to €25m. Giannelli Imbula’s father told <strong>Téléfoot </strong>on Sunday that his son could accept a move to the Serie A side. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to <strong>Sky Italia</strong> today, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur have entered into the race to sign the central midfielder. Giannelli Imbula’s father has announced on <strong>RMC</strong> that it is a three horse race for his son between Inter Milan, Valencia and an English side, although we believe that VCF have now pulled out. He also confirmed that there was a 90% chance that the player will leave Marseille this window. According to <strong>Gianluca di Marzio</strong>, Imbula has already agreed a provisional contract with Inter Milan.</span></p>
