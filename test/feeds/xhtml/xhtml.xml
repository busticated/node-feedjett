            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Here&#39;s a guilty admission. I don&#39;t make a habit of watching news conferences on television. If I&#39;m not covering the game or an event or whatever, I usually don&#39;t stick around for the question-and-answer sessions. I&#39;d rather read about it the next morning in stories and columns carefully crafted by the guys asking the questions.</p>
                <p>I trust the professional writers and reporters to tell me what&#39;s relevant. Call me old-fashioned.</p>
                <p>Such was the case this morning when I awoke and started digesting the articles from the last night&#39;s Game 4 of the NBA Finals. Under that disclosure I begin this blog post, which is a second-hand reaction to the manufactured drama created by local Miami sports radio stations this morning. Apparently during his post-game last night, LeBron James didn&#39;t refer to the Miami Heat by name when recalling one of his more career-defining playoff accomplishments.</p>
                <p>I didn&#39;t know about it until an editor called me. Why? Because of all the accounts of last night&#39;s action, and all the news-gathering efforts of my colleagues covering the Finals, no one mentioned it in their stories. Go figure. Was it all over Twitter last night? Probably, but I wasn&#39;t.</p>
                <p>So, here&#39;s what happened...A reporter asked LeBron about his career&#39;s biggest challenge and the Cavaliers&#39; forward pointed to the 2012 Eastern Conference finals. <strong>But LeBron didn&#39;t refer to the Heat by name.</strong> Instead, he said &quot;the other franchise I was with...&quot;</p>
                <p>Oh. No. He. Didn&#39;t.</p>
                <p>To hear my editor tell it, sports radio land was ready to start a war with Cleveland this morning over such an obvious and disrespectful omission. After our quick conversation about the ridiculous world we live in, I dipped my foot into our great society&#39;s alternate universe of self righteousness, and, sure enough, Twitter never disappoints â€” much grinding and gnashing of the teeth there.</p>

                <p xml:base="http://blogs.herald.com/FEET/">Well, yes. Boredom.</p>
                <p>LeBron is apparently going to take passive-aggressive shots at Pat Riley and the Heat, and <a href="http://blogs.herald.com/miami_heat/2015/04/did-lebron-mislead-pat-riley-last-summer-during-free-agency-with-a-smiley-face-emoji.html" target="_self">Pat Riley and the Heat apparently are going to make passive-aggressive swipes at LeBron</a>. And it&#39;s all so tiresome.</p>
                <p>Can this be over, please? Can Miami finally let it go? Can LeBron move on with his career and stop snubbing his nose at the Heat&#39;s front office?</p>
                <p>The Heat trailed the Celtics 3-2 in that 2012 Eastern Conference series before winning Game 6 in Boston and Game 7 in Miami. James&#39; performance in Game 6 is legendary. He had 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists. It was every bit as magical as anything he has done so far in these Finals, and he did it in a Heat uniform. The Heat made him who he is today, and, in turn, LeBron made the Heat what it is today. He should have his jersey retired inside AmericanAirlines Arena. Period. End of discussion. All this &quot;Heat lifer&quot; stuff is obviously hot garbage. After all, the guy who coined the phrase (Dwyane Wade) is now, apparently, not against leaving the team if he can&#39;t get a new contract.</p>
                <p>Please, let&#39;s all stop pretending and just enjoy these Finals, and the guy who used to play for the Heat.</p></div>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Did LeBron James mislead Pat Riley last summer during free agency with a smiley face emoji?</p>
                <p>Here&#39;s the circumstantial evidence... <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab02970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sherlock-Holmes-Sherlock-Holmes-detective-crime-smiley-emoticon-001232-facebook" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab02970d img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab02970d-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Sherlock-Holmes-Sherlock-Holmes-detective-crime-smiley-emoticon-001232-facebook" /></a><br /><br /></p>
                <p>â€” On Monday, Riley was asked about the draft and next season and the Heat&#39;s president, in classic Riley style, dropped a loaded one-liner, which was immediately interpreted as a dig at LeBron. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab91970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Emotes_face_embarrassed" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab91970d img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ab91970d-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Emotes_face_embarrassed" /></a><br /><br /><br /><strong>&quot;No more smiling faces with hidden agendas, so we&#39;ll be going in clean,&quot; Riley said.</strong> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca919970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sarcasticemoji-2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca919970b img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca919970b-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Sarcasticemoji-2" /></a></p>
                <p>â€” Asked to clarify if that comment was about James, Riley said, <strong>â€œthat could be anyone across the board,â€</strong> before adding, â€œ<strong>Iâ€™ve already got about half a dozen emails from people I donâ€™t even know recommending [a player], and somewhere in that email or text is always a smiley.â€</strong>&#0160;</p>
                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca9d6970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="OKemoji" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca9d6970b img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77ca9d6970b-75wi" style="width: 70px;" title="OKemoji" /></a></p>
                <p>OK, first question: Who the heck has the liberty to send Riley a text-message emoji other than, say, his kids?</p>
                <p>I don&#39;t see Heat general manager Andy Elisberg shooting off an emoji text to Pat Riley:</p>
                <p>ANDY: The Final Four was cray. Cal...LOL...BTW, Sam Dekker. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ad5e970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Surprisedemoji" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ad5e970d img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820ad5e970d-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Surprisedemoji" /></a></p>
                <p>Nick Arison doesn&#39;t strike me as the emoji type...</p>
                <p>NICK ARISON: Let&#39;s move up in the draft. This kid from Duke is a BALLR. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cac73970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Emoticon-Devil-Devilish-Evil-icon" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cac73970b img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cac73970b-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Emoticon-Devil-Devilish-Evil-icon" /></a></p>
                <p>But, seriously people, is it so hard to believe that LeBron sent Riley a smiley face emoji last season that Riley misinterpreted as some sign that LeBron was returning to Miami?</p>
                <p>RILEY: Hey <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820af88970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Yellow-goat-md" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820af88970d img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201bb0820af88970d-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Yellow-goat-md" /></a>, getting ready for next season yet?</p>
                <p>LEBRON: <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cad11970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Happy_smiley_face_mischievous_sinister_smilie_sticker-r6fb1d133fdce416892ba15f4a78df091_v9wth_8byvr_512" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cad11970b img-responsive" src="http://blogs.herald.com/.a/6a00d83451587d69e201b7c77cad11970b-50wi" style="width: 40px;" title="Happy_smiley_face_mischievous_sinister_smilie_sticker-r6fb1d133fdce416892ba15f4a78df091_v9wth_8byvr_512" /></a></p></div>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Heat likely needs a victory tonight to remain in the playoff race, and the good people at <a href="http://www.numberfire.com/nba/teams/power-rankings" target="_self">numberFire</a> have provided us with some projections to quantify just how desperate the Heat now finds itself with three games left in the regular season.</p>
                <p>According to projections, the Heat has a 17 percent chance of making the playoffs entering tonight&#39;s home game against the Toronto Raptors. For a complete breakdown of tonight&#39;s game plus an in-depth look at the playoff race, <a href="http://blogs.herald.com/miami_heat/2015/04/in-depth-look-at-tonights-game-between-the-heat-and-raptors-plus-all-the-playoff-race-stuff.html" target="_self">CLICK THIS LINK.</a></p>
                <p>After losing on Thursday to the Bulls, the Heat&#39;s playoff chances dropped 17.4 percent. According to numberFire, the Heat has a 3.7 percent chance of finishing seventh in the East and a 13.3 percent chance of finishing eighth in the East. Here are the current projections for all four teams in the Eastern Conference playoff race:</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Nets - 82.9 percent (up 11.6 percent)2. Celtics - 81.8 percent (up 12.1 percent)<br />3. Pacers - 18.7 percent (down 5.5 percent)<br />4. Heat&#0160; - 17.0 percent (down 17.4 percent)</p>
                <p>The Heat isn&#39;t facing a true &quot;must-win&quot; scenario tonight, but it&#39;s close enough. A victory against the Raptors would give the Heat at least a chance to stay in the playoff picture. A loss to the Raptors coupled with wins by the Nets and Celtics on Sunday would eliminate the Heat from the playoff picture.</p></div>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><strong><strong>RAPTORS (46-32)</strong></strong> AT HEAT (35-44)<br /></strong></p>
                <p>When/Where: 7:30 p.m., AmericanAirlines Arena, Miami</p>
                <p>TV/Radio: Sun Sports and NBA TV/FM 104.3, AM 790 and MIX 98.3FM (Spanish)</p>
                <p>Series: Heat leads the all-time series 48-22 and 28-8 in games played in Miami. Heat is 1-1 against the Raptors this season. The Raptors snapped its 16-game losing streak to the Heat on March 13 and can now win the season series between the two teams for the first time since 2008. The last time the Raptors defeated the Heat at AmericanAirlines Arena was Nov.19, 2008.</p>
                <p>Line: Opened at Heat by 3. Heat now favored by 3 1/2.</p>
                <p><strong>INJURIES:</strong> Chris Andersen (left foot sprain), Luol Deng (left knee sprain), Hassan Whiteside (right hand laceration) and Dwyane Wade (hip/knee pain) are probable; Henry Walker (right knee soreness) is out; Chris Bosh (blood clot), Josh McRoberts (right knee meniscus) and Shabazz Napier (sports hernia) are out for the season. For the Raptors, Amir Johnson (sprained right ankle) is out.</p>

                <p><strong>SCOUTING REPORT: </strong>With three games left in the regular season, the Heat desperately needs a victory on Saturday night. The Heat has three games left in the regular season and now trails the Nets and Celtics by two games in the loss column after both teams won in convincing fashion on Friday night. The Pacers are earned an important victory, which further complicated the Eastern Conference playoff race. It&#39;s not a true must-win scenario for the Heat, but another loss could doom the Heat&#39;s playoff chances all the same.</p>
                <p>While the Nets and Celtics enjoyed games on Friday against teams resting players or preparing for the playoffs, the Heat has no such luck on Saturday against the Raptors. Toronto can secure home-court advantage in the playoffs with a victory against the Heat.</p>
                <p>The Raptors are averaging almost 10 points per game more than the Heat this season. The Heat is 28th in the league in points per game (94.4), 24th in three-point field goal percentage (.335) and last in rebounding (38.9). The Heat has lost five of its last six games and eight of its last 11. The Raptors won in dramatic fashion on Friday night in Orlando with Sixth Man of the Year candidate Lou Williams hitting a game-winning three-pointer with 9.9 seconds remaining.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry isn&#39;t expected to play more than 30 minutes, according to Toronto coach Dwane Casey. Lowry recently missed time to recover from several injuries caused by the wear and tear of the season. He played 33 minutes on Friday against the Magic. Casey said Lowry might have played too many minutes against Orlando, but the Raptors needed the win to help secure home-court advantage for the first round of the playoffs.</p>
                <p><strong>Starting lineups</strong><br />Heat: Luol Deng, Udonis Haslem, Hassan Whiteside, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic<br />Raptors: Terrence Ross, Tyler Hansbrough, Jonas Valanciunas, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry</p>

                <p>Line: Opened at Bulls by 1. Bulls now favored by 1 1/2.</p>
                <p><strong>INJURIES:</strong> Chris Andersen (left foot sprain), Luol Deng (left knee sprain) and Hassan Whiteside (right hand laceration) are probable; Michael Beasley and Mario Chalmers are questionable with illnesses; Chris Bosh (blood clot), Josh McRoberts (right knee meniscus) and Shabazz Napier (sports hernia) are out for the season. For the Bulls, guard Derrick Rose (right knee) and Kirk Hinrich (hyperextended left knee) are questionable.</p>
                <div style="width: 1px; height: 1px; color: #000000; font: 10pt sans-serif; text-align: left; text-transform: none; overflow: hidden;"><br />Read more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article17357804.html#storylink=cpy</div>
                <p><strong>SCOUTING REPORT:</strong> With an identical record as the Toronto Raptors, the Chicago Bulls will be playing for playoff position tonight against the Heat. The Bulls hold the playoff tiebreaker against the Raptors. Derrick Rose started for the Bulls on Wednesday scored nine points in 20 minutes in Chicago&#39;s 105-103 loss. The introduction of Rose into the Bulls&#39; rotation this late in the season is a risk for Bulls coach Tom&#0160;Thibodeau, but one worth taking considering Rose&#39;s MVP-ability when healthy. The Bulls will be looking to strengthen its continuity tonight against the Heat, so expect Rose to start again despite the back-to-back scenario.</p>
                <p>Bulls guard Jimmy Butler, a candidate for Most Improved Player, will be looking for a bounce-back game against the Heat after a poor showing (five points) against Miami in January. That game featured Hassan Whiteside&#39;s triple-double breakout performance on national television. Another national television showcase, the Heat will be playing for a spot in the playoffs. Wins by the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night dropped the Heat to 10th in the Eastern Conference standings, but the Heat only trails the eighth-place Brooklyn Nets by one game in the loss column.</p>
                <p><strong>Projected starting lineups</strong><br />Heat: Luol Deng, Udonis Haslem, Hassan Whiteside, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic<br />Bulls: Mike Dunleavy, Pau Gasol, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose</p>

                <p><strong>SCOREBOARDING</strong></p>
                <p>Tonight&#39;s games that will affect the Heat&#39;s playoff push...</p>
                <p><strong>Bulls at Heat:</strong> A victory would put the Heat in place in the East and a half game behind the Nets. The Heat holds playoff tiebreakers against the Celtics and Nets. The Pacers hold the playoff tiebreaker against the Heat.</p>

                <p><strong>Boston at Cleveland:</strong> LeBron James indicated on Wednesday that he could sit out this game and also the next to rest for the playoffs. Both games are against Boston, which is locked in a playoff race with the Heat. Back-to-back wins for the Celtics against the Cavaliers would keep the Celtics in the driver&#39;s seat for the seventh seed and a match-up with the Cavs in the first round.</p>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The NBA is going to Cuba.</p>
                <p>The professional basketball league announced on Tuesday that it is hosting a development camp in Havana on April 23-26. Recently retired guard Steve Nash and NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo are two of the players who will lead the four-day event, scheduled to be the first visit to Cuba by an American professional sports entity since President Barack Obama announced plans to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
                <p>&quot;We&#39;ve seen the bridges that basketball can build between cultures,&quot; NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum said. &quot;We look forward to sharing the values of our game with Cuban youth and learning together through the common language of sports.&quot;</p>
                <p>Initial planning for the NBAâ€™s trip to Cuba came together not long after President Obamaâ€™s announcement in December that the United States and Cuba would begin steps towards restoring full diplomacy between the governments of both countries. An advance team from the NBAâ€™s league office in New York visited Cuba in early March. During those meetings, Cuban officials were enthusiastic about the NBA conducting a camp.</p>
                <p>The big question I&#39;m sure everyone is now wondering: Will the Miami Heat play a preseason game in Cuba anytime soon? It&#39;s certainly possible â€” the New York Cosmos soccer team is playing the Cuban National Team on June 2 â€” but there are no current plans for the Heat, or any other NBA team, to play an exhibition game in Cuba, according to a league source.</p>
                <p>Though isolated in many ways from the United States for half a century, Cuba has fostered a strong foundation of basketball development over the decades. The menâ€™s national team won a bronze medal at the 1974 Summer Olympics, and the womenâ€™s national team finished third at the 1990 FIBA World Championship. The womenâ€™s team most recently won the FIBA Americas championship in 2013.</p>
                <p>In addition to the development camp for the Cuban Menâ€™s and Womenâ€™s National Teams, the NBA and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) also plan to refurbish three basketball courts during the trip and also conduct two youth clinics. The NBAâ€™s trip to Cuba is in association with the Cuban sports ministry, Cubaâ€™s National Institute of Sport, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER) and the Cuban Basketball Federation.</p>
                <p>â€œThis is a great day for Cuban basketball and our federation,â€ said CBF president Ruperto Herrera. &quot;To have both the NBA and FIBA collaborate on youth instruction and the development of the game in our country is magnificent.</p>
                <p>â€œWe thank the Republic of Cuba and INDER for opening the doors for these basketball camps that will end up benefiting the future of national and international basketball.&quot;</p>
                <p>In addition to the participation of Nash and Mutombo, WNBA legend Ticha Penicheiro will also provide instruction during the basketball camp. Other camp instructors include Orlando Magic coach James Borrego, Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder, Utah Jazz assistant coach Brad Jones, USA Basketball youth development coach Don Showalter and Victor Ojeda, director of the Basketball Academy of the Americas.</p>
                <p>&quot;In the continued effort to strengthen our national federations, it is extremely gratifying to see Cuba serve as the center of a development camp of this magnitude,&quot; FIBA President Horacio Muratore said. &quot;This is a country that loves basketball and we are proud to work together with the NBA on this historic venture.&quot;</p>
                <p>Tommy Sheppard, the Washington Wizardsâ€™ vice president of basketball administration, along with New York Knicks associate athletic trainer Anthony Goenaga and FIBA Americas referee Geraldo Fontana also will conduct workshops for coaches, trainers, and other sports professionals, according to a news release by the NBA.</p></div>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>HEAT (34-42) AT <strong>PACERS (33-43)</strong></strong></p>
                <p>When/Where: 6 p.m., Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indianapolis, Ind.</p>
                <p>TV/Radio: Sun Sports/FM 104.3, AM 790 and WAQI 710AM (Spanish)</p>
                <p>Series: Pacers lead the all-time series 41-57. Heat is 1-2 against the Pacers this season, losing in Miami 81-75 on Nov.12 and losing 106-95 on New Years Eve in Indianapolis. The Heat defeated the Pacers 89-87 on Jan.23.</p>
                <p>Line: Pacers were 6 1/2-point favorites before tip off.</p>
                <p><strong>INJURIES:</strong> Dwyane Wade (left knee contusion) and Udonis Haslem (illness) are questionable. Hassan Whiteside (right hand laceration) also is questionable. Chris Andersen (left foot sprain) is questionable. Chris Bosh (blood clot), Josh McRoberts (right knee meniscus) and Shabazz Napier (sports hernia) are out for the season. For the Pacers, Rodney Stuckey is probable (sore right wrist).</p>

                <p><strong>SCOUTING REPORT:&#0160;</strong>This one feels like a must-win scenario for the Heat after Saturday&#39;s loss to the Pistons. Unfortunately for Miami, the Pacers have momentum on their side. Forward Paul George returns to basketball tonight after breaking his leg last summer with Team USA. Heat center Hassan Whiteside re-injured his lacerated right hand on the Heat&#39;s final defensive play of the game against the Pistons. Whiteside confirmed that the 10 stitches between his middle and ring fingers came apart. He was a late scratch from Sunday&#39;s game.</p>
                <p>In addition to Whiteside&#39;s setback, Heat reserve center Chris Andersen injured his foot in the first half against the Pistons and was also a late scratch against the Pacers. With Whiteside and Andersen out of action, Henry Walker was inserted into the lineup alongside leaves Udonis Haslem, the Heat&#39;s only healthy center. Haslem started on Saturday at power forward but struggled after missing consecutive games due to an illness. </p>
                <p>The Pacers have lost two consecutive games and nine of their last 11, but, despite the late-season slide, Indiana could tie the Heat for ninth in the East with a victory tonight. The Heat has lost six of its last eight games.</p>
                <p><strong>PLAYOFF TIEBREAKERS: </strong>With the Heat trailing the Pacers 1-2 in the season series , the Heat needs a victory to give itself a chance at the playoff tiebreaker. The head-to-head playoff tiebreaker between the Heat and Pacers could be determined by conference won-loss record if the Heat wins tonight. The Pacers currently are 24-24 against Eastern Conference teams. The Heat is 22-24 against the East.</p>
                <p>â€”A victory tonight would tie the the Heat with the Celtics for eighth in the East. The Heat holds the playoff tiebreaker against the Celtics, having defeated Boston three out of four this season.</p>
                <p>â€”The Heat trails the Nets by one in the loss column for seventh in the East. The Heat holds the playoff tiebreaker against the Nets, having defeated Brooklyn this season in all four meetings between the two teams.</p>
                <p><strong>Projecting starting lineups</strong><br />Heat: Luol Deng, Henry Walker, Udonis Haslem, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic<br />Pacers: Solomon Hill, David West, Roy Hibbert, C.J. Miles, George Hill</p>

                <p><strong>SCOUTING REPORT: </strong>Wade was considered doubtful after re-aggravating the bone bruise inside his left knee on Thursday, but is now expected to play against the Pistons. Wade participated in the Heat&#39;s shootaround on Saturday morning and said, &quot;Today was a positive day for me.&quot; Wade scored 40 points against the Pistons last week after having fluid drained from his left knee. Hassan Whiteside didn&#39;t play against the Pistons a week ago but will be in the starting lineup tonight against Pistons center Andre Drummond.</p>
                <p>The Heat has lost two consecutive games since defeating the Pistons 109-102 in Miami.</p>
                <p><strong>Starting lineups</strong><br />Heat: Luol Deng, Udonis Haslem, Hassan Whiteside, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic<br />Cavaliers: Caron Butler, Anthony Tolliver, Andre Drummond, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Reggie Jackson</p>

                <p><strong>WADE RELIEVED</strong></p>
                <p>Dwyane Wade feared the worst after bashing his left knee against the court on Thursday against the Cavaliers. The Heat&#39;s shooting guard was relieved to learn that he only aggravated a preexisting injury. The Heat&#39;s trainers were able to limit the amount of swelling in Wade&#39;s knee overnight, which should give him a chance to be effective in tonight&#39;s game against the Pistons.</p>
                <p>&quot;Our trainers did a great job and the biggest part when you have an injury like I had, and you have a bone bruise, obviously you have swelling, so itâ€™s about how much swelling you have and we tried to do a good job on the plane of padding it up and making sure it didnâ€™t swell as much,&quot; Wade said. &quot;I have a little swelling in it, so thatâ€™s going to determine if Iâ€™m able to get it settled down. Then you worry about the other parts of your body that was affected that you donâ€™t even know about. But today was a positive day for me.â€</p>
                <p><strong>PLAYOFF IMPLICATIONS</strong></p>
                <p>A victory tonight for the Heat will move the team one game closer to securing a spot in the playoffs. A loss could be devastating. The Heat is eighth in the standings, and one game behind the Boston Celtics in the loss column. The Heat plays the Indiana Pacers on Sunday, and the game will be an emotional one for the Pacers. The team announced on Saturday that Paul George, who broke his leg over the summer playing for Team USA, will make his long-awaited return against the Heat.</p>
                <p>â€œWeâ€™re fighting for the playoffs,â€ Wade said. â€œWeâ€™ve got less than two weeks until itâ€™s determined, and you just want to give it your best shot. We got a great opportunity tonight to do that, and tomorrow it keeps coming.â€</p></div>
