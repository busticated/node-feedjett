<p><span class="drpCap">I</span>t&#8217;s been a fantastic season for the Blues. Winning the Premier League is a huge achievement for any club, and every <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/chelsea/">Chelsea</a> fan must be delighted with their team&#8217;s performance this season.</p> <p>Winning almost 70% of their league games and only losing three times is a typical of a team who were runaway champions and were without doubt the finest team in the highest level of English football this season. This is without even acknowledging their professional performance in the League Cup, putting in a classic <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/jose-mourinho/">José Mourinho</a> performance against Tottenham.</p> <p>Only <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/southampton/">Southampton</a> rivalled Chelsea in terms of the quality of their summer acquisitions last year as <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/diego-costa/">Diego Costa</a>, Thibaut Courtois and <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/cesc-fabregas/">Cesc Fàbregas</a> all came in to light up the Premier League.</p> <p>However where Chelsea really flourished this season, was not in their attacking play but in their amazing defensive work.</p> <p>The old bastion of <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/john-terry/">John Terry</a> and understudy Gary Cahill as well as the understated yet industrious <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/cesar-azpilicueta/">César Azpilicueta</a> at left-back and the solid Serbian <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/branislav-ivanovic/">Branislav Ivanović</a> at right-back with all the defence bar Azpilicueta making the Team of the Season.</p> <p>The extremely well-disciplined defence shut out most teams from scoring at all by conceding fewer goals than any other team this season and got 10 goals and eight assists between them, demonstrating both their immense defensive and offensive capabilities.</p> <p>This is without even mentioning the PFA player of the year, the mercurial <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/eden-hazard/">Eden Hazard</a>.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17018" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chelsea-vs-Maribor-300x169.jpg" alt="Chelsea playing against Maribor in what was a disappointing Champions League campaign" width="300" height="169" />In undoubtedly his finest season in football, the little Belgian was masterful this season, scoring 14 and assisting nine from left-wing and creating an incredible 100 chances, fully earning his status as the best player in the Premier League this season.</p> <p>One aspect of Chelsea&#8217;s season which could be scrutinised would be their performances in the Champions League, where the Blues bowed out earlier than they should have given the calibre of their side to Paris Saint Germain despite their opponents being a man down.</p> <p>The team didn&#8217;t reflect their domineering league performances in Europe&#8217;s finest competition and this will surely be an area where Mourinho will be striving to improve for the 15/16 season.</p> <p>Chelsea&#8217;s recent transfer dealings weren&#8217;t perfect either, letting André Schürrle leave for <a href="https://provenquality.com/germany/wolfsburg/">Wolfsburg</a> along with Belgian star <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/kevin-de-bruyne/">Kevin De Bruyne</a> cannot be looked upon as great moves for Chelsea, the latter setting a Bundesliga record of 21 assists last season. However, given Chelsea&#8217;s financial muscle, they have enough about them to bring in someone just as good or even better than De Bruyne this upcoming season, if they want to.</p> <p>With Oscar and Fàbregas currently competing for the number 10 role and Cuadrado and <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/willian/">Willian</a> for the wide role, do Chelsea even need to replace De Bruyne and Schürrle?</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17020" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chelsea-Celebrate-League-Win-300x221.jpg" alt="Premier League Champions Chelsea celebrate their victory" width="300" height="221" />Their operations in the transfer market last season were successful, players such as Fàbregas and Matic have settled right back into the Premier League, hence why both were considered for the Team Of The Year.</p> <p>Not to mention Diego Costa who, especially in the earlier parts of the season, looked perfect for the physical side of the Premier League and netted an impressive 20 goals in his debut season and could have got more, had his recurring injury problems not held him back.</p> <p>The fact that <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/petr-cech/">Petr Čech</a> looks set to be allowed to leave by Jose Mourinho is testament to the incredible ability of the Belgium number 1 <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/thibaut-courtois/">Thibaut Courtois</a> who at 23, could potentially be the Chelsea stopper for fifteen more years.</p> <p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s been a superb season for everyone involved in Chelsea FC, and the fans will be looking on to next season to see what else this club can achieve.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/chelsea-season-review/">Chelsea : A season in review</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">O</span>n the 29th May, it was announced that Spurs had completed their first signing of the season in the form of Austrian centre-back and promising talent <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/kevin-wimmer/">Kevin Wimmer</a>.</p> <p>Reportedly commanding a fee in the region of 6-10 million euros, Wimmer was short-listed for the 2014/15 Bundesliga Team of the Season, after he had an excellent season at the heart of the FC Köln defence.</p> <p>Having played so well, he attracted the attention of <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/tottenham-hotspur/">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, where he was bought in mind of plugging the gaps in the leaky Spurs defence, who conceded as many goals as 16th place <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/sunderland/">Sunderland</a> last season.</p> <p>With misfits <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/younes-kaboul/">Younès Kaboul</a> and Vlad Chiricheș expected to leave this summer, Wimmer&#8217;s main competition as yet include young <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> prospect Eric Dier, Belgium national <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/jan-vertonghen/">Jan Vertonghen</a> and experienced Argentinian Federico Fazio.</p> <p>Standing 1.87m tall, he is a defender mainly relying on his physical attributes when it comes to aerial duels, rarely over-committing in the tackle hence his mere three yellow cards last season.</p> <p>The quality of his longer passes is varied, but he is capable of some excellent diagonals and well-weighted balls. However, he does show signs of suffering from an all too common problem among centre-backs who rely too heavily on their physique &#8211; a poor first touch, especially when under heavy pressure, evidenced by the games against <a href="https://provenquality.com/germany/bayern-munich/">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="https://provenquality.com/germany/bayer-leverkusen/">Bayer Leverkusen</a>. He is only 22 however and with his best years ahead of him, such skills can be honed and improved as he develops at Spurs.</p> <p>Wimmer possesses good pace for a man of his stature &#8211; something which rival Fazio desperately lacks. It’s plain to see why Tottenham’s scouting staff have sought after Wimmer.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17012" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kevin-Wimmer-FC-Koln-300x300.jpg" alt="Kevin Wimmer playing for FC Koln" width="300" height="300" />While he still has things he needs to improve, he is a young and hard-working centre-back who has the potential to become a solid Premier League performer. He is certainly strong and robust enough to deal with the English style of play, whilst his conservative approach to defending should also serve him well.</p> <p>Whilst he is reasonably attentive to the positioning of opposition forwards, he does have a tendency to switch off at times; however, again this skill will be sharpened with time and training.</p> <p>Currently, Wimmer will have to really impress Pochettino if he is to surpass Jan Vertonghen or Eric Dier in the pecking order, with the former being a mainstay of the Tottenham defence and the latter demonstrating real attacking potential in the latter games of the 14/15 season, a rare skill amongst the Spurs back-line.</p> <p>It appears that, with good additions this summer, Spurs could be a top-four challenging side if they get the defensive situation sorted, and Wimmer looks like a positive step in the right direction.</p> <p>All in all, Kevin Wimmer could be a very promising signing for Tottenham, and could finally prove the defensive answer that <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/daniel-levy/">Daniel Levy</a> has been seeking and that Spurs fans have been demanding for years.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/kevin-wimmer-can-bring-spurs/">Kevin Wimmer &#8211; What can he bring to Spurs?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">P</span><em>otential </em>could very well be the most frivolously used word in modern football, particularly when concerning young English footballers. You don&#8217;t have to look far to find the &#8216;next Ronaldo&#8217; or the &#8216;next Messi&#8217; &#8211; so how does a footballer avoid a fate similar to the once lauded <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/bojan-krkic/">Bojan Krkić</a>?</p> <p><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, a young player who has not managed to play 30 games in any of his 4 seasons in <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/arsenal/">Arsenal</a>&#8217;s first team, might be asking himself just that. Although an injury-plagued career is not uncommon at Arsenal Football Club, the Ox might be becoming increasingly concerned at his position in Wenger&#8217;s improving squad.</p> <p>Since joining the Gunners for £12 million in 2011, the <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> International has been injured for a combined 359 days, which has not only affected his progress, but also his pecking order in his berth of positions. When fit, Chamberlain has proved his brilliance on a consistent basis for both club and country, however, his lack of availability has hindered his chance of securing a place in either team.</p> <p>Particularly at Arsenal, the Ox has become something of a luxury to <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/arsene-wenger/">Arsène Wenger</a>, a player he can use to plug the holes left by other absentees, but while improving his versatility, this inclusion is also preventing the player from becoming a vital part of a first eleven.</p> <p>Take this season for example, the Englishmen has played 13 times as an Attacking Midfielder (Right), four times as a Right Midfielder and six times in a central midfield role, even performing well as a part of a defensive structure.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16984" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Petr-Cech-300x182.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Petr Cech, wanted by Wenger?" width="300" height="182" />While<a href="http://provenquality.com/wayne-rooney-james-milner-curse-versatility/" target="_blank"> other examples of versatile English players</a> James Milner and Wayne Rooney have been ever present for their teams, albeit in any position, Chamberlain hasn&#8217;t and has been left on the bench for 9 of the 30 games he&#8217;s been available for.</p> <p>The question at hand, &#8216;Can Oxlade-Chamberlain fulfil his potential at Arsenal?&#8217; is particularly pertinent at the time of the rumoured swap deal <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/chelsea/">Chelsea</a> have offered Arsenal, seeing the young talent going the opposite way to <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/petr-cech/">Petr Čech</a>. Although Wenger himself no doubt sees the deal as laughable, it must spark imagination in Chamberlain&#8217;s thoughts considering he is not currently held in Wenger&#8217;s first eleven.</p> <p>Chamberlain needs to play games at 21-years-old, and if that will be at Arsenal, which looks almost certain, then he needs to claim a position for his own &#8211; most logically on the right of the attack.</p> <p>Something which might add encouragement is the revelation that the last three months out that Chamberlain has endured, have actually been spent weaning the England forward off of painkillers that he has been taking for the last few years in order to cope with long-term injuries. Chamberlain himself admitted that he had forgotten what it felt like to play without pain, and given this successful period, this only offers optimism to the Oxlade-Chamerlain cause.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16986" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Oxlade-Chamberlain-300x225.jpg" alt="Oxlade-Chamberlain in action for Arsenal" width="300" height="225" />Despite it probably always being the case with young footballers, the coming season will definitely prove to be the most decisive in Chamberlain&#8217;s career so far.</p> <p>Not receiving a phone call from <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/gareth-southgate/">Gareth Southgate</a> to join the U21 squad could prove to be a blessing for the Ox as he can now concentrate on the unenviable task of trumping the likes of Walcott, Özil and Ramsey in the Arsenal squad.</p> <p>Chamberlain has the quality and the time he needs to make it to the top, however, he needs to act fast if he&#8217;s going to make it there with Arsenal.</p> <p>Despite being one of the best talents in both England and Arsenal&#8217;s squad, the winger is becoming forgettable, and that definitely needs to change. Lets hope that this new year is the year of the Ox.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/can-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-fulfil-potential-arsenal/">Can Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fulfil his potential at Arsenal?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[
don team of the 1980’s and <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>’s Italian forward <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/mario-balotelli/">Mario Balotelli</a>. This article will try to explain some of the reasons behind this observation.</p> <p>John Fashanu was born in Kensington, <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> in September 1962 to a Guyanese mother and Nigerian father. Following his parents’ separation, John and his elder brother Justin were sent to Barnardo’s children’s home. Aged five the brothers were adopted by Alf and Betty Jackson and raised in the couple’s family home in Attleborough. In the 1960’s Norfolk, as it is today, wasn’t as diverse as the capital, yet despite this the brothers didn’t encounter any racism in their early years in East Anglia.</p> <p>28 years after Fashanu’s birth, a Ghanaian couple’s first son was born in <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/palermo/">Palermo</a>, <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/">Italy</a>. They named him Mario Barwuah. The family moved from Sicily to Brescia, in the north of the country, when Mario was two years old. The following year he was placed in care, on the authority’s suggestion, and fostered by Silvia and Francesco Balotelli, a middle class family. Mario found it hard growing up in a predominantly white country where some find it hard to accept other ethnicities, however he was accepted by his new family and has a strong relationship with his adopted parents.</p> <p>John Fashanu started his career at <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/norwich-city/">Norwich City</a>, and following spells at Lincoln City and Millwall, joined Wimbledon for a then club record fee of £125,000. As a player Fashanu was well known for his physical attributes, which would fit in well with Dave &#8216;Harry&#8217; Bassett’s preferred style of play. Before embarking on a professional football career, the 6’ 2” forward had been a keen amateur boxer. This aggressive side to his character was highlighted in the BT Sport documentary, with himself and Vinnie Jones recounting a story of a fight at the Don’s training ground with a new team-mate. The validity of this incident may be questioned as other team-mates suggest the story of the fight may have been retold over-dramatically. However it does emphasise the striker’s aggressive streak. This side to him also came out on the pitch; a brutal clash with Spurs’ Gary Mabutt left the defender with broken skull and eye socket. In Fashanu’s own words,</p> <blockquote><p>There were times when we were 200 per cent physical. We believed we were warlords because at three o’clock on a Saturday, it was war.</p></blockquote> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-16930" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mario-Balotelli-fights-with-Roberto-Mancini-300x294.jpg" alt="Mario Balotelli fighting with Roberto Mancini" width="265" height="259" />Mario Balotelli made a name for himself in Italy with <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/inter-milan/">Inter Milan</a> before being described as “unmanageable” by then Nerazzurri boss <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/jose-mourinho/">José Mourinho</a>, and departed his homeland in the summer of 2010 to follow former manager <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/roberto-mancini/">Roberto Mancini</a> to <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a>. During their time together the pair had a tempestuous relationship, with Mancini saying in an interview;</p> <blockquote><p>Every day I fight against Mario and sometimes I would like to give him a punch.</p></blockquote> <p>Balotelli’s interests outside football include martial arts, something he informed reporters in response to his manager’s quote, ‘He couldn’t. I do Thai kick-boxing.’ Despite this, they were subsequently seen confronting one another on the club’s training ground. This wasn’t the first time Balotelli had been involved in confrontations, having been spotted scrapping on separate occasions with then team-mates Nigel de Jong, Micah Richards, Kolo Touré and Jérôme Boateng.</p> <p>While both players can prove to be no shrinking violets with a tendency to quickly use violence, they could also both be described as characters with possible delusions of grandeur. Fashanu, speaking in the 3rd person about himself, insinuated that he was the leader of the dressing room,</p> <blockquote><p>Fash was a physical bastard and you would either have to adapt or dissolve as a person. The players ran the club and if you were a wise manager, you would work with us, not against us.</p></blockquote> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16926" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mario-Balotelli-why-always-me-171x300.jpg" alt="Mario Balotelli displaying his 'Why Always Me?' shirt" width="171" height="300" />Following the programme being broadcast Dave Bassett, manager of the Crazy Gang at the time ridiculed his suggestions, ‘Fash has disrespected the legend of the club and the legacy has been tarnished because of his contribution to the programme.’ Others involved concurred, with goalkeeper Dave Beasant saying he was disappointed the forward had overstated some of the stories for dramatic effect.</p> <p>One of Balotelli’s most infamous moments on the pitch came during Manchester City’s derby victory at Old Trafford in 2011. After scoring, the Italian revealed a T-Shirt with the message “Why Always Me?”. This followed reports in the media on the morning of the game that Balotelli had let off fireworks in the bathroom of his rented mansion. Instead of the focus being on the comprehensive nature of the result, the column inches were shared with the antics of the controversial forward.</p> <p>As the documentary confirmed, John Fashanu is the type of person who enjoys believing they are the centre of attention. As his former manager Dave Bassett says;</p> <blockquote><p>(John) has embellished stories and played up to the camera. He should have been honest and shown respect to those who played alongside him and to those who achieved so much before him. It is a shame and players from that great Wimbledon team are very disappointed in him, because he has attempted to glamorise something that was already very special.</p></blockquote> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16924" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/John-Fashanu-239x300.jpeg" alt="John Fashanu playing for Wimbledon" width="239" height="300" />An example of this is Fashanu describing lining up before Wimbledon’s FA Cup final match against Liverpool in 1988, ‘John Barnes is close friend and I said things to him in that tunnel that only a black man could say to another black man’, however as the cameras focus on the players there is no evidence of this &#8211; and Barnes denies any comments being made to him.</p> <p>After Fashanu’s football career ended he stayed in the public eye, first by presenting the original series of the game show Gladiators, before appearing in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me out of Here in 2003. Now a businessman, he was also the host of &#8216;Deal or No Deal&#8217; in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following Balotelli’s arrival in England, the media interest has built up. Many stories followed with tales of run-ins with police; when stopped he was found to be carrying £5,000 in cash and when asked by police why, he reportedly replied: &#8220;Because I am rich&#8221;, schoolchildren; apparently when a young autograph hunter said he was the victim of bullying, Balotelli drove to the school to intervene, a women’s prison; Balotelli once drove with his brother, Enoch, unauthorised into a detention centre in Brescia, Italy before being stopped at the gates, and training bibs; in the warm up before a Europa League game against Dynamo Kiev at the Etihad in 2011, the then Manchester City striker struggled to put on his kit and the footage subsequently went viral.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16933" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/John-Fashanu-Vinnie-Jones-300x169.jpg" alt="John Fashanu with fellow infamous Wimbledon hard man Vinnie Jones" width="300" height="169" />In conclusion there are a number of similarities in their upbringing and character. However there are also a number of differences between the two. Despite both regularly being the centre of attention, it appears that while the Italian may be involved in silly incidents both on and off the football pitch, it is because he hasn’t thought through the consequence of his actions, while Fashanu is keener on courting controversy and attention even if what is claimed isn’t true; as has been proven by others’ recounts of past events. This trait may be due to the fact that when he was growing up, trying to make a profession from football, he was also in the shadow of his older and more talented brother Justin.</p> <p>When Justin came out as gay in an interview with The Sun newspaper, John disowned his brother, telling The Voice that Justin was &#8220;an outcast&#8221; and shockingly saying in New Nation newspaper,</p> <blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve washed my hands of him. I&#8217;ve helped him so much in the past financially, emotionally and spiritually. I&#8217;ve got eight brothers and sisters and Justin is old enough now to stand on his own two feet. He&#8217;s a big man.</p></blockquote> <p>Although expressing remorse after Justin took his own life in 1998, Fashanu later told the BBC he believed his brother “wasn’t really gay”, but was merely “seeking attention”. In 2013 Amal Fashanu, John’s daughter and Justin’s niece presented a BBC documentary, “Britain’s Gay Footballers”.</p> <p>In terms of achievements on the football field, Balotelli and Fashanu cannot be compared. Despite only being 24 years old, Balotelli’s list of honours include three Serie A titles and the Champions League with Inter, a Premier League and FA Cup with Manchester City, and a European Championships runners up medal with Italy, for whom he has scored 13 goals from 33 appearances. In contrast, Wimbledon’s famous FA Cup triumph was Fashanu’s only major honour in a 17 year playing career and he only managed to make two appearances for England without scoring.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/mario-balotelli-new-john-fashanu/">Is Mario Balotelli the new John Fashanu?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">O</span>ne of the best sub-plots of the season is that of Villa&#8217;s story. The first half of the season I can imagine was almost intolerable for most Villa fans, seeing <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/paul-lambert/">Paul Lambert</a>&#8217;s side score 12 league goals from 25 games, the lowest in Premier League history.</p> <p>No key players were performing, the football was drab, the team scored an incredibly low amount of goals and the pressure built up to a point where on the 11th of February, Lambert was fired after a disappointing 2-0 loss at fellow strugglers <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/hull/">Hull</a> City.</p> <p>All seemed lost for the Villains, it looked as if they were going down in what would be their most dismal season in the top flight to date.</p> <p>Then, along came <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/tim-sherwood/">Tim Sherwood</a>, former Spurs boss and Villa&#8217;s poor season took a change for the better when <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/christian-benteke/">Christian Benteke</a> converted a winning last-minute penalty against rivals <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/west-brom/">West Brom</a>.</p> <p>Only four days later, Villa repeated the feat at Villa Park against the Baggies, sending them to the FA Cup semi-finals and the fans into raptures, prompting a pitch invasion.</p> <p>Benteke really hit form in the business end of the season, scoring 9 in the final 10 games of the season, and helping Sherwood&#8217;s side no end in their bid to avoid relegation, not to mention the on-loan Tom Cleverley who proved doubters wrong in the Villa midfield.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16902" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fabian-delph-goal-semi-final-300x169.jpeg" alt="Aston Villa beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi final" width="300" height="169" />It was then semi-final day at Wembley where <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/aston-villa/">Aston Villa</a> put in one of the performances of the season against heavily favoured <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>, where young star Jack Grealish and <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> midfielder <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/fabian-delph/">Fabian Delph</a> shone in their 2-1 triumph.<br /> Things were looking even better as the end of the season approached, with Sherwood calming Villa nerves by steering them from relegation with vital wins against former employers &#8211; Spurs, <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/west-ham/">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/everton/">Everton</a>.</p> <p>It all looked set up to be the turn-around of the season, with Aston Villa facing FA Cup holders <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/arsenal/">Arsenal</a> at Wembley in the final &#8211; after all it was Arsenal&#8217;s cup to lose.</p> <p>Some quietly favoured Villa after their mostly excellent performances in the league and their battling performance against Liverpool in the semi-finals, others were sceptical after their unusual 6-1 drubbing at high-flying <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/southampton/">Southampton</a>.</p> <p>The latter proved to be right, as Villa put in one of the most uninspired Cup final performances in recent years, with the Gunners putting four past Shay Given.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16901" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shay-Given-300x169.jpg" alt="Shay Given" width="300" height="169" />Whilst it has to be said that Villa were very poor in the final, their opponents &#8211; Arsenal were magnificent, notably <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/alexis-sanchez/">Alexis Sánchez</a>, scoring one of the best FA Cup final goals to date.</p> <p>However, Villa fans can look upon this season with a mixture of feelings, obviously disappointment in their terrible start to the season and their thrashing in the final, whilst also being proud of the strong end of the season and their excellent cup run.</p> <p>If Aston Villa can hold on to the young talent of Jack Grealish, workhorse and captain Fabian Delph and prolific striker Christian Benteke, we can expect Sherwood&#8217;s side to be far higher up the table next season.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/aston-villa-season-review/">Aston Villa: A season in review</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">V</span>ersatility is heralded in the world of sport. Footballers that can defend as well as attack are seen as the heart and soul of a team. They are supposed to embody what every player should strive to be, well rounded and hard working.</p> <p>A versatile player should have a much greater chance than his counterparts for a starting role because of the number of positions that they can occupy. After all, who would not want to be adept in multiple areas as opposed to just one?</p> <p>Contrary to what many may believe, versatility can be a hidden drawback rather than a blessing. In fact, managers often take advantage of their player’s wide skill set. By analysing the careers of two English talents, we can fully understand that versatility comes with not only pros, but cons as well.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/james-milner/">James Milner</a></h4> <p><a href="https://provenquality.com/england/aston-villa/">Aston Villa</a> fan’s view of James Milner polarize the views that the rest of the world has of the <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> international. The majority of fans following the Premier League think of Milner as being a hard working, gritty sort of player. One that can do a job for you whether he plays right back, left midfield, or central midfield. At <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a>, Milner was a pure workhorse. He filled in at forward when Agüero was injured, he filled in central midfield when the central midfielders were injured, and he filled in out wide when an outside back was injured. However, Milner was not always characterized like this.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16894" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/James-Milner-300x169.jpg" alt="James Milner" width="300" height="169" />In his Aston Villa days, the hard working midfielder was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year award. Now, he wasn’t selected based on the distance he covered during a game, or his hard working mentality. He was nominated for his attacking prowess and talent going forward. Milner occupied a central midfield position where he would drive at opposing defences and create opportunities for others.</p> <p>After arriving at Manchester City, his imagination going forward dried up, but why? The simple answer was his versatility. Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, both managers at City during Milner’s stay at the Etihad, recognized his versatility. When injuries came their way, who was the man who had to sacrifice his normal position for the sake of the team? Milner. The two managers morphed Milner from a robust central midfielder to a useful utility man. After rotating between multiple positions, Milner has lost his drive and spark in central midfield. Versatility brought him a level down from what he was.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/wayne-rooney/">Wayne Rooney</a></h4> <p>The second English talent we can look at is Wayne Rooney. Now many would agree that Rooney is far superior in terms of raw talent than Milner. However, even he, a player that is world class on his day, has been shunted around his team. In fact, Rooney has had to deal with this for almost his entire career.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16895" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Wayne-Rooney-2-300x180.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="300" height="180" />Think back to the early 2000’s, when a young Rooney had just recently arrived from <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/everton/">Everton</a>. Ronaldo’s arrival, and Ryan Giggs place in the squad meant he was shunted between out and out forward, second striker, and left midfield roles. His best position comes at second striker, however, he has rarely been given an entire season to play that role.</p> <p>In the 2007-2009 seasons, Ronaldo was played in Rooney’ favoured position through the middle. In addition, Tevez was in the mix meaning Rooney was played in either the wide right or wide left positions. Once again, versatility allowed Ferguson to sacrifice Rooney’s role for the team. Rooney had only two seasons playing in his best position at forward. Both seasons he scored 34 goals. However after these two seasons, he has been shifted back into central midfield, right midfield, and even holding midfield. Versatility has not allowed Rooney to showcase his best form. Sir Alex Ferguson was able to sacrifice his role as opposed to others because of his broad skill set.</p> <p>Versatility in a player is a wonderful asset for the manager and the team as a whole. This allows for sufficient cover for multiple positions. However, versatility hurts players individually when they are not allowed to settle into their best position. Rooney and Milner are prime examples of versatility negatively effecting individuals. Managers of versatile players should recognize that by using a highly skilled player as a utility man, they are doing more harm than good to a player&#8217;s career.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/wayne-rooney-james-milner-curse-versatility/">Wayne Rooney, James Milner and the curse of versatility</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

e <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> will be the official title of the top flight, the first time it has been without a sponsor since its inaugural season back in 1992. Sources suggest the change is a strategic move to create a &#8216;clean brand&#8217; in line with most U.S. sporting organisations such as the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball, however it will still pinch the pocket financially. The last deal made with Barclays resulted in a £120 million windfall for the Premier League, and it&#8217;s uncertain whether this is a permanent move or simply a temporary one until a suitable and respected brand can be negotiated with.</p> <p>With that in mind, here are four potential sponsors that would jump at the chance of partnering with the most popular league in world football.</p> <p><b><u>Sports Direct Premier League</u></b></p> <p>Funded by a £200 million loan paid through the already strained finances of Rangers PLC, Sports Direct founder <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/mike-ashley/">Mike Ashley</a> would take the Premiership to another level. Match day mascots would be replaced by zero hour Sports Direct staff who are available at an hour&#8217;s notice. All merchandise would be run out of Ashley&#8217;s stores and all stadiums would be hastily fitted with his companies logo. Overall cost cutting across the board would steer the (premier) ship to sensible but utterly boring shores.</p> <p><b><u><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/fifa/">FIFA</a> Premiership</u></b></p> <p>The one thing FIFA needs right now is positive press and getting behind the world&#8217;s greatest league is a plum move. Of course, there would be some requirements that are non-negotiable.<br /> All newly promoted teams would play their home games in Dubai to expand the worldwide market, all disciplinary hearings would be resolved diplomatically between 12-18 months and any side that commits a handball must pay €5 million to the opposing team to avoid future legal ramifications.</p> <p><b><u>The ITVBe Premmie</u></b></p> <p>The recently launched ITV spin-off channel has not reached the echelons of success since its birth in October 2014. A lucrative sponsorship deal would be a potential goldmine for ITV and also tap into a new market of football fans to its existing and predominantly female audience. Of course the Saturday night highlights programme da&#8217; Premmie would be removed from the safe hands of the BBC and placed on the ITVBe channel, at the earlier time of 5.15pm and presented by Christine Bleakley and Joey Essex. The programme will be followed by the spin off show More of da&#8217; Premmie, where instead of the actual games, the fly on the wall show focusses on the viewers of the earlier Premmie show and the everyday conflicts that occur. Think Gogglebox but not Gogglebox for legal reasons.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16880" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image3-300x251.jpg" alt="Disney Premier League" width="300" height="251" /><b><u>Disney League Soccer</u></b></p> <p>The quickest and boldest revamp in the league&#8217;s history sees a major re-branding campaign as the Premier League becomes the DLS, all teams are assigned an official Disney Mascot and nickname. All team specific sponsorship deals involving alcohol are banned as is spitting, one footed tackles, bad or moderate language and chewing gum. However ticket prices are lowered, younger fans are encouraged and the football itself is resized appropriately.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/premier-league-goes-bare/">Premier League goes bare</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p>The transfer window has started to creak into action over the last couple of days, with a number of deals being confirmed across Europe.</p> <p>Of the players to put pen to paper this week, four pieces of them have caught my attention, with all the acquiring clubs doing positive early business in my opinion.</p> <p>Here are the four deals analysed.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/mauro-icardi/">Mauro Icardi</a> &#8211; Inter contract extension</h4> <p>Arguably the biggest deal across the continent over the last 48 hours has seen Mauro Icardi move…..nowhere.</p> <p>The Argentine striker has penned a new deal with Roberto Mancini’s Inter side, in a massive boost for the Serie A sleeping giants.</p> <p>The <em>Nerazzurri</em> had a season to forget in 2014-15, with an eighth place finish an indication of the dire state of affairs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.</p> <p>Only two things can really be seen as a positive for Inter from the recently completed campaign; cross-town rivals <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/ac-milan/">AC Milan</a> <a href="https://provenquality.com/ac-milans-baffling-recent-managerial-record-compounding-demise/" target="_blank">are in even more strife</a> and Mauro Icardi’s goalscoring rush.</p> <p>The former <a href="https://provenquality.com/spain/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> youth player took the <a href="https://provenquality.com/leaving-barcelona-risk-and-reward-cristian-tello-oriol-romeu-and-mauro-icardi/" target="_blank">brave decision to leave Camp Nou</a> for first-team football and has shown over the last 12 months why he is the <a href="https://provenquality.com/dybala-icardi-vietto-latest-legacy-devastating-argentine-attackers/" target="_blank">next in a long line of great Argentine strikers</a>.</p> <p>Regardless of Inter’s struggles, Icardi netted an impressive 22 league goals to finish joint top scorer with Luca Toni.</p> <p>With <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/chelsea/">Chelsea</a> and other leading European clubs said to be interested in the South American, the fact that Inter have kept their star man is a massive boost for the club <a href="https://provenquality.com/five-key-reasons-serie-a-has-fallen-behind-its-european-equivalents/" target="_blank">and Italian football in general</a>.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/james-milner/">James Milner</a> &#8211; <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a> &#8211; <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/liverpool/">Liverpool</a></h4> <p>Reds fans have been split in their opinion of the club’s first summer acquisition, with the <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/">England</a> international moving to Anfield on a free transfer.</p> <p>Although Milner is no Steven Gerrard, his versatility and work-rate will have been key reasons Brendan Rodgers opted to bring him to Merseyside.</p> <p>The former City man has the ability to play in central midfield, even if it is not his natural position, but in my opinion the veteran could well be an excellent option for the Reds at right wing-back.</p> <p>This has been an area of concern since Rodgers opted to move to a back three, but Milner’s positional sense, tireless running and distribution could well suit the role.</p> <p>Liverpool need more new blood at the club if they are to make a dent on the top four next season, but all-in-all someone of Milner’s experience and ability on a free transfer can’t be seen as bad business.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/fabian-schar/">Fabian Schär</a> &#8211; Basel to <a href="https://provenquality.com/germany/hoffenheim/">Hoffenheim</a></h4> <p>Swiss centre-half Schär has been mooted with a move away from his homeland for some time now, with the goalscoring defender a <a href="https://provenquality.com/hidden-gems-fc-basel/" target="_blank">bright light in Basel’s generation of young stars</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/242714.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16871" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/242714-300x200.jpg" alt="Fabian Schär" width="300" height="200" /></a>Although major European clubs have been mentioned as suitors, a move to Hoffenheim seems like the ideal next step for the 23-year-old.</p> <p>With the potential to play in the more-demanding Bundesliga and every chance that he will slot straight into Markus Gisdol’s side, the transfer suits all parties.</p> <p>The ambitious German outfit have continued to press their place in the top half of the Bundesliga and if they can keep star playmaker Roberto Firmino at the Rhein-Neckar Arena who knows how far they can go next term.</p> <p>Schär needs a new challenge after proving himself repeatedly in his homeland, with a move to <a href="https://provenquality.com/germany/">Germany</a> making sense. More importantly he has signed for a club at the right level.</p> <h4><a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/lucas-vazquez/">Lucas Vázquez</a> &#8211; <a href="https://provenquality.com/spain/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> to <a href="https://provenquality.com/spain/espanyol/">Espanyol</a></h4> <p>Following an impressive campaign on loan at the Barcelona-based club, winger Lucas Vázquez has penned a permanent deal to see him switch to the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat for good.</p> <p>This tricky right winger has <a href="https://provenquality.com/the-evolution-of-lucas-vazquez-real-madrids-on-loan-old-school-winger-eyed-by-liverpool/" target="_blank">proven himself as someone more than capable</a> of excelling in the Spanish top flight, but the chance to do this at his boyhood club in the capital was never going to be forthcoming.</p> <p>Talk of Liverpool potentially being interested in the wide midfielder made sense, but Vázquez staying in his homeland and furthering his footballing education at a club that has embraced him was the right choice.</p> <p>Although not enough of a superstar name for Real Madrid, Espanyol have made a shrewd signing who can all the attributes to be a real star in La Liga again in 2015-16.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/four-deals-analysed-icardi-milner-schar-and-vazquez/">Four deals analysed: Icardi, Milner, Schär and Vázquez</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">A</span>lmost a week ago to the day, a 3-2 win in Warsaw sealed <a href="https://provenquality.com/spain/sevilla/">Sevilla</a>&#8217;s Europa League honour for the second year in a row. <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>&#8217;s side beat FC Dnipro with the help of two goals from their talisman <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/carlos-bacca/">Carlos Bacca</a>, which took their fourth European trophy back to Seville.</p> <p>Whilst the <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> trophy took Sevilla ahead of three-time winners <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/juventus/">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://provenquality.com/italy/inter-milan/">Inter Milan</a>, it also put their best assets in the limelight, in this case Carlos Bacca and Unai Emery.</p> <p>Not many will be looking to leave <em>Los Rojiblancos</em> this summer, however with it rumoured that Emery&#8217;s impressive project since joining in 2013 could be over, it might be considerably less appealing for the playing stars to stay. The star man in question, Carlos Bacca, has also just completed his second season in Seville after joining for just<strong> </strong>€7 million from Club Brugge.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Colombian started his career at Atletico Junior of Barranquilla in Colombia, and had numerous successful loan spells across the continent before making his way to European football. He then scored 28 goals in 45 games in Belgium before making the step up to a top European league in the form of <a href="https://provenquality.com/spain/">Spain</a>&#8217;s La Liga.</p> <p>Bacca&#8217;s career has been very progressive up to this point, which begs the question of whether he should take his next step now, during what most would consider as the &#8216;prime&#8217; of his career. The striker&#8217;s impressive end to the season has attracted interest from the likes of <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/manchester-united/">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://provenquality.com/england/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>, and whilst this might be hard to ignore, Bacca is left with the decision of whether to &#8216;stick&#8217; or &#8216;twist&#8217;.</p> <p>While most see a prospective move as logical, the Colombian might consider a stay in Seville &#8211; owed to the club&#8217;s participation in the Champions League in the coming season &#8211; a fresh challenge.</p> <p>Bacca&#8217;s agent, Sergio Barila, has not been muted on the situation and has publicly said, &#8220;Carlos wants to stay in Europe, and next year Sevilla play in the Champions League and he would be happy to play there with Sevilla&#8221;. However, the agent also commented that if the player was made available by the club then he has &#8220;more chances&#8221; of playing in Serie A than in any other competition.</p> <p>The Colombian reportedly has a €30 million release clause inserted in his contract which, if asked to be met, could easily put off potential suitors given the player&#8217;s age.</p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16858" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Unai-Emery-300x169.jpg" alt="Sevilla's coach, Emery, could also be on his way out" width="300" height="169" />Sevilla need to decide themselves whether they are prepared to make extensive attempts to keep the striker, which they are similarly doing with manager Unai Emery.</p> <p>Sources in Seville have indicated that Emery would be more prepared to stay, upon the guarantee that their squad would not be cherry-picked.</p> <p>Perhaps the question is, Unai Emery: stick or twist? as much as it is for Bacca.</p> <p>If Bacca does decide to leave, a move to United could seal a similar fate to fellow countryman Radamel Falcao, who failed to make adequate impact, whilst a move to Liverpool would ensue the impossible task of replacing Luis Suárez.</p> <p>Bacca scored 20 goals for Sevilla this season and would definitely be valuable for any team that he lines up for next season, however, the striker needs to decide what represents the best value for him.</p> <p>With the Copa América on the horizon, it is sure to be a busy summer for the striker and he has some tough decisions to make &#8211; does he follow a similar path to the likes of Soldado and Negredo, or does he repay the club that have already provided him with two major honours?</p> <p>One thing that we can be sure of is that the Bacca will be a very prominent figure in European football next season.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/carlos-bacca-stick-sevilla-twist-manchester-united-liverpool/">Carlos Bacca: Stick at Sevilla or twist with Manchester United or Liverpool?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drpCap">T</span>he following may or may not be excerpts from the diary of <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/fifa/">FIFA</a> kingpin <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/sepp-blatter/">Sepp Blatter</a>, in the week that shocked world football.</p> <p><b><u>Tuesday 26th May</u></b></p> <p>Tough day. Putting the finishing touches to our annual Zürich conference<strong>.</strong> Had a good dinner with Jack and Eugenio where we discussed business and our favourite Swiss bank foyers. Had a glass of wine before heading upstairs where I opened yet another present from my new <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/qatar/">Qatar</a>i friends. I get into my silk jam jams and get a rare early night.</p> <p><b><u> Wednesday 27th May</u></b></p> <p>I&#8217;ve had better wake up calls it must be said. I had planned on having a lie in but I heard an almighty ruckus outside my room. I poked my head outside to see what all the fuss was. I saw several American lawmen handcuffing my boys and throwing linen sheets on their heads. They don&#8217;t deserve to be treated like that. One of the men walked over to me and asked my name to which I responded &#8220;Sir, I am the great French actor Gérard Depardieu, kindly remove your extradition order from my gorgeous face.&#8221; He puffed his cheeks and walked away. I shut my hotel room door and hid under the bed until 1pm. I recited a statement while I was under there and emailed it to my spokesman, Walter De Gregorio. I told him to tell the truth&#8230; that we welcome any investigation and that we are an esteemed and moral organisation that focuses on the passion of football and not our own interests. I then had a shower, purchased Ru Paul&#8217;s Drag Race Season 5 off the iTunes using my FIFA Platinum credit card. Those strange ladymen don&#8217;t get abused the way I do. They should spend a day in my shoes but I assume they would prefer heels. Hahaha! I&#8217;m going to use that one tomorrow in the press conference.</p> <p><b><u>Thursday 28th May</u></b></p> <p>I was supposed to be attending a medical meeting in the morning but I backed out so they could get on with business. Instead I read the papers and saw that everyone was calling me nasty names. That made me angry so I got dressed and decided that I would make an appearance. I went in the side entrance as there were too many supporters at the front that wanted to cheer me inside. The conference itself was quite boring, I played Angry Birds through most of it. People still play that, don&#8217;t they?</p> <p><b><u>Friday 29th May </u></b></p> <p>Today&#8217;s the day of the presidential vote. I make my calls to the various organisations stating why they should believe in me and my principles. A lot of them seemed scared of what I would do to them if they voted for Prince Ali. I told them they are free to vote for whomever they want &#8211; I made a note of those scared countries just in case. I make my way to the conference and give a rousing speech. The votes are cast and I win the first round but not by enough to win outright. I speak with Prince Ali and offer him a chance to leave with dignity, which he accepts. Ali stands down as a nominee. I WON! I can&#8217;t believe it! I get applauded on stage by my friends and recite an old speech I gave last time. What a day! I&#8217;m so happy.</p> <p><b><u>Saturday 30th May</u></b></p> <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16832" src="https://provenquality.cdn.speedyrails.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image-300x180.jpg" alt="FIFA president / comedy super-villain Blatter" width="300" height="180" />Massive hangover. I eventually get up at 3pm for a meeting with some of the participants in this Summer&#8217;s Women&#8217;s <a href="https://provenquality.com/tag/world-cup/"><a href="https://provenquality.com/features/world-cup/">World Cup</a></a>. They are very pretty and have nice bottoms. I don&#8217;t tell them that but I sneak a peek as they sign a football that will get auctioned off for charity.</p> <p><b><u>Sunday 31st May</u></b></p> <p>David Gill rang me today to say that he&#8217;s resigning as Vice President. These Brits are so dramatic, anything that doesn&#8217;t go their way, they get their knickers in a twist. He can leave for all I care. He threatens that he will try to get UEFA to boycott any future World Cups but I don&#8217;t believe him. UEFA is like Diet Coke&#8230;it&#8217;s full of goodness, causes weight loss, but ultimately you just wish you had the real thing.</p> <p><u><b>Monday 1st June</b></u></p> <p>The media don&#8217;t seem to have found anything to talk about apart from the corruption nonsense. It&#8217;s exhausting. Why can&#8217;t they all just go away. They seem to be whispering about a $10 million payment that Jérôme Valcke authorised and a potential bribe scandal but I don&#8217;t see the connection. He simply accepted money in return for a favour. The sponsors of our tournaments are getting upset, I don’t understand why though, as they slide envelopes under my hotel room door most days, some of which have money in them which is strange as it’s not my birthday. I keep the money anyway, it’s always handy to have in case I get stopped in the street by one of those guys asking me to help the homeless.</p> <p><b><u>Tuesday 2nd June</u></b></p> <p>Woke up quite tired today. All this extradition mumbo jumbo is rather irritating. I&#8217;ve been the boss of football for over twenty years now and maybe it&#8217;s time for someone else to realise what a ball-ache it is. Besides, I can still give my opinions and I&#8217;m sure I would be welcome in any future conferences. I&#8217;ve given all my time and energy to this job and now I should concentrate on me. I haven&#8217;t even seen Mad Max Fury Road yet for Christ&#8217;s sake! Some of my accused colleagues have been assured by the F.B.I that they will show it on the flight to the U.S.</p> <p><small>*Sepp, this article is obviously satirical, please don&#8217;t even think about suing us when <del>you get out of prison</del> are completely exonerated.</small></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com/sepp-blatter-diary/">Sepp Blatter&#8217;s diary</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://provenquality.com">Proven Quality</a>.</p>
